# NumbersOCR
Optical character recognition using reference images of numbers

# Example - 

Input image (included in the project above) :
![Example Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenShapira/NumbersOCR/master/ImageOCRExample/Images/Samples/sample1.PNG "Example Image")

Would result with the integer : 6240

Same logic with a few adjustments can be used to OCR everything as long as a character references can be provided in advance.
